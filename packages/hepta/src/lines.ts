/**
 * Lines of thought. The part of Hepta that thinks about something other than
 * the sentence in front of it.
 *
 * The seven tongues in index.ts are the FOREGROUND: several readings of what is
 * being said right now, none allowed to commit until the speaker stops. That
 * is listening. It is not conversation. Conversation needs the other lines:
 *
 *   what you said five minutes ago, and whether this contradicts it
 *   a view it holds, and whether what you are about to do runs against it
 *   something left open, that it can wander back to when you go quiet
 *
 * Each is a Thread, and every thread is evaluated on every partial, in
 * parallel with the foreground. That is what "multiple lines of thought" is
 * here: not one model thinking harder, but several small questions asked of
 * each word as it arrives, each with its own memory of where it came from.
 *
 * Three behaviours come out of that, and each has a rule, because each is
 * something a person forgives in a friend and not in a machine:
 *
 * CUTTING IN. People interrupt at clause boundaries — after "and", "but", a
 * breath — not in the middle of a word. A system that cuts in mid-phrase is
 * rude however right it is. So an urge to speak waits for a boundary, unless
 * it is urgent enough that waiting would cost more than the rudeness (about
 * to confirm a payment that contradicts what it knows).
 *
 * HOLDING THE FLOOR. While it is speaking and you say "yeah", it keeps going;
 * that is a backchannel, not a turn. "Wait" or "no" or three real words is a
 * turn, and it stops. Stopping on every "mm" is why voice assistants feel
 * like they are being shouted down.
 *
 * ARGUING. A stance carries evidence and a confidence. A reason from you
 * lowers the confidence, and below a floor it concedes. An override from you
 * — "do it anyway" — ends the argument: you are the conductor, the stance
 * yields, and the disagreement is recorded so it is not raised again unless
 * something new comes up. A debater that cannot lose is not arguing, it is
 * nagging, and one that argues more than once per disagreement at default
 * bluntness is the same thing with better manners.
 *
 * WANDERING. When nothing is on stage and you have gone quiet, it may pick an
 * unresolved thread and go back to it. Weight decays with time, rises when
 * the thread's words come up again, and a thread just raised rests.
 *
 * None of this generates language. A decision says what to raise and why; a
 * model says it. Every detector here is tier 0 — word overlap and numbers —
 * and the `Detector` interface is where a fast classifier (Jev-class) plugs in
 * when it is available. The rules around the detectors do not change when the
 * detectors get better, which is the point of keeping them apart.
