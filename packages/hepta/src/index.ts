/**
 * Hepta — "il faut tourner sept fois sa langue dans sa bouche avant de parler."
 *
 * The proverb is a rule about restraint, not about speed: you may think as many
 * times as you like, but you do not speak until the turning stops. That is
 * exactly the contract this package enforces.
 *
 * While someone is still talking, Hepta keeps several candidate acts alive at
 * once — up to seven — scoring each against the partial transcript and painting
 * the leader on the stage immediately, so the interface is already most of the
 * way there when the sentence ends. None of them may commit. A partial
 * utterance has no silence in it: the speaker has not stopped, so there is
 * nothing to read as assent. `ActRun.speculative` holds every track at
 * `speculating` until the transcript is final, and only then does the commit
 * contract get to decide.
 *
 * What this is NOT: a speech model. Hepta does not listen, transcribe or speak.
 * It speculates on INTENT over whatever transcript a recognizer hands it, which
 * is the part AIUIC owns.
