/**
 * The pyramid. One conductor, three roles, and a loop.
 *
 *            conductor          the person. The only one who can make a thing true.
 *               │
 *          congregator          the record of everything done. The only writer.
 *           ╱        ╲
 *   orchestrator    aggregator  proposes / reads
 *
 * The idea as it was given: three agents working recursively, each needed for
 * anything to be fully built, as a triple check.
 *
 * The part changed on the way to code: three agents checking each other is
 * not three checks if they are the same model underneath. Their errors are
 * correlated, and three votes for a wrong answer read as one confident wrong
 * answer. So the roles here do not vote. They hold different AUTHORITY, and
 * the check is that nothing can cross from one to the next except through an
 * interface the next one owns:
 *
 *   aggregator    reads. Returns findings. Has no handle to propose or write.
 *   orchestrator  decides what is needed. Returns a plan. Has no handle to write.
 *   congregator   records. Has no public write method at all — it records what
 *                 the contract reports as committed, and what the loop did.
 *   conductor     assents. A proposal becomes a commit only through the act
 *                 contract, and a proposal nobody spoke into cannot pass the
 *                 engagement gate, so it waits for an explicit yes.
 *
 * A mistake then has to get past three different kinds of gate, not three
 * copies of the same judgment. That is what "triple check" can honestly mean.
 *
 * The recursion is real and bounded: a plan may split a goal into subgoals,
 * each pursued with the same three roles one level down, and their results
 * come back up through the congregator. It stops at a depth budget and on a
 * goal it has already seen in the current chain — otherwise "recursive" means
 * "loops until the bill arrives".
